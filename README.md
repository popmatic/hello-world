# hello-world
This is what I'm putting out there so I can actually figure out how github works.
 
I'm just following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ because that's the only way I learn. I have to do something.  However, I'm also terrified of ruining someone's project (which I realize probably can't happen, but you never know) so I just needed to find something that explained how it works.

And here we are. Now I feel you are all more up-to-date on things.  I feel better.
